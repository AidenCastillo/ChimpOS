# Critical Issues
Bug in handle_escape_sequence - line with -'0' at the end has syntax error
Memory allocation issues in the filesystem implementation
Missing function definitions for harddrive filesystem functions
Linker errors with multiple symbol definitions across modules
# Code Quality
Inconsistent error handling across modules
Missing documentation for public functions
Hard-coded magic numbers in terminal and filesystem code
Lack of proper parameter validation in many functions
# Core OS Features to Implement
Process management system (scheduler, context switching)
Paging and memory protection
Complete the modular filesystem implementation
System call interface
User/kernel space separation
Implement a simple shell with more commands
# Debugging Infrastructure
Complete the debug logging system
Add memory debugging tools (leak detection, heap validation)
Implement panic handler for fatal errors
Add stack tracing capability
# Testing
Add more comprehensive test cases for the filesystem
Create test cases for memory management edge cases
Implement stress tests for the heap allocator
Add automated boot tests
# Build System
Create configuration system for selecting components at build time
Implement clean dependency tracking in Makefile
Add build variants (debug, release, etc.)
Support for cross-compilation to different architectures
# Documentation
Create architecture overview document
Document kernel API for future user programs
Add better code comments
Create contributor guidelines
